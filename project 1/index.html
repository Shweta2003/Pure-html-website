        My name is <em style="background-color: #bbdefb;">Shweta Mandal</em>.<br/>
        I belong from a village background there are five members in my family including me. <br/>
        Though we have from a farmers’ family as my grandfather was handling agricultural business,<br/>
         my father is not doing work in the field all the time. Nowadays our family’s main income source<br/>
         \ is the poultry farm and my father gives maximum time to this business, field-related works are limited now.<br/><br/>

I have two siblings among them one is my sister and the second one is my younger brother.<br/>
 I am the first child in my family so from the earlier days i got a lot of love and support from all the family members.<br/>
  <em>I am so much a favorite of my grandparents and most of my childhood time I spent with them in the village</em>.<br/><br/>

I had started my primary education in village school, That days with so many memorable incidences still in my mind.<br/>
 Though that school was so simple but basic education and values i had learnt from this school.<br/>
  Almost all types of childhood games i played that time, where i had so many friends too.<br/>
   I didn’t know where the day ended and our naughty activities and games were never going to end.<br/><br/>

Up to the class 7th education i have completed from the village school, and my father was so much insistent <br/>
about admitting me to town school for my next education. Though it was not an easy decision for me to <br/>
move on in new place and new school by leaving my grandparents, village school and friends. But my school<br/>
 teacher was always advising me one thing that is,<em style="background-color: #bbdefb;">” If you want to achieve something, You have to be ready for sacrifice something”</em>.<br/><br/>

My teachers words somewhere convinced me and i had accepted their suggestion, but from the bottom of my <br/>
heart i was emotional on that day when i left my village and grandparents’ home. And with my parents,<br/>
 I had moved on to the town where we have already a home.<br/><br/>

That time everything was new for me, where i didn’t know much more about town. But before starting new school <br/>
I had traveled to most of the locations in town with my parents and some places was well known to me soon after some days.<br/><br/>

I was good in study and since childhood my dream was about to become a mechanical engineer, so from class<br/>
 eight i started focusing on learning new things. Apart from school most of the time i was spending in school <br/>
 library because reading is my favorite hobby since childhood. With new friends and school days i didn’t<br/>
  realized how two years passed on and i got admitted in class 10th.<br/><br/>

I knew very well this three years are so crucial in my career that I must give my best efforts so that <br/>
only I will be able for engineering admission. Meanwhile, I was missing my village and old friends, <br/>
so during summer vacation, I was always going to meet them in the village.<br/><br/>

I started daily six hours of study in class on the 10th my target was above 90 percent anyhow about to score.<br/>
 And in the last two months before final exam of class 10th, with very honest efforts and dedication, I studied hard.<br/>
  As per my expectations exam was good and happily i solved all the questions. So final result was according to that <br/>
  and <em>I had achieved 96 percent marks, Main important thing was my mathematics and science subjects marks, where I scored out of marks</em>.<br/><br/>

    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        Ofcourse the above details are not about me!!!<br/> I am from computer background.. duh!
         Anyways this is an essay on myself I just copied from google,<br/>
         <em style="background-color: #b7ddb0;">
            <a href="https://www.gyanipandit.com/en/essay-on-about-myself/#:~:text=Steps%20on%20How%20to%20Write%20an%20Essay%20About,Opinion%20and%20Thoughts%20about%20Human%20Life.%20More%20items" target="blank">
         you can see it too!!!</a></em> 
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        
I was so much happy as well as excited that i will going to admit in college, Like everyone’s i had also new <br/>
hopes and excitement about college life. But that was the vital time of my life, which was going to make be<br/>
 able for engineering admission and i was committed about my dreams.<br/><br/>

I joined the science stream and Accordingly that I started to spend more hours in the college library studying.<br/>
 And in rest of the time we friends were playing cricket on college ground.<br/><br/>

One year had passed on, In that time I had done enough preparation for the class 12 exam. I knew if i will score good <br/>
marks in this examination then i will not only get into a good college for engineering but also my admission will be <br/>
confirmed for engineering. Accordingly that i had given all contributions and scored good marks in class 12th,<br/>
 I got a good percentage which could confirm my admission for engineering.<br/><br/>

Luckily <em style="background-color: #bbdefb;">i got admission in government engineering college where i achieved mechanical engineering branch</em> and <br/>
that was the most happiest moment in my life. From earlier I decided that for four years I have to study hard so<br/>
 according to that I had joined regular coaching classes for important subjects and attended regular college classes.<br/>
  Every semester i achieved good marks, while i was attending seminar projects etc related with my engineering stream.<br/><br/>

Finally, I completed my engineering education with honor degree rank, and after two months there was a campus interview arranged. <br/>
Among 58 students I got selected for a campus job interview, Where I was placed in good company.<br/><br/>

<em>Since 4 years i am working in this company on good designation, Also I am fulfilling my hobbies</em>.<br/>
 Now i am living my well-settled happy life with my family and in my free time, I feel proud somewhere on me and my life journey.<br/><br/>

              Developed through the technological architecture of electrical engineering and the computational language of mathematics,<br/>
               the science of computer technology has provided considerable recognition and financial gain for many of its well deserving pioneers.<br/>
                Originally conceived as an organizational solution to the massive amounts of information kept on nothing more than paper,<br/>
